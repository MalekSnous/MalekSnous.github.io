# About Me

I am a Data Scientist & Machine Learning Engineer with a strong academic foundation (PhD in Applied Mathematics) and practical experience across ML research, AI systems, scientific computing, and large-scale data analysis.

My interests include:
- applied machine learning  
- LLM systems & RAG architectures  
- probabilistic modeling  
- data visualization  
- multi-omics analysis  
- GPU computing  

I am passionate about **solving real-world problems with data**, building scalable ML pipelines, and designing AI solutions that combine scientific rigor with practical impact.

Beyond work, I enjoy contributing to open-source, mentoring junior scientists, and exploring new developments in AI research.
