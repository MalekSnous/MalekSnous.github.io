# 🚀 Data Science & ML Projects

Welcome to my project showcase.  
Below you’ll find a selection of technical work demonstrating my skills in Machine Learning, AI Engineering, data visualization and scientific computing.

## 🧠 1. LLM Scientific Assistant (RAG System)
**Technologies:** Python, LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI API, FastAPI

A domain-specific assistant built to:
- retrieve scientific knowledge from thousands of documents  
- synthesize multi-source insights  
- prevent hallucinations through citation-driven reasoning  
- track temporal freshness of data  

**Key features**
- RAG pipeline with semantic search  
- relevance re-ranking  
- prompt engineering framework  
- production-ready API  

👉 *Repository coming soon*

## 🔬 2. Single-Cell ML Pipeline (PhD Project)
**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, Scanpy, scVI, UMAP, Leiden

Large-scale ML workflow analysing millions of single-cell RNA-seq datapoints.

Highlights:
- probabilistic models for cell-state inference  
- dimensionality reduction  
- graph-based clustering  
- reproducible pipeline with Snakemake  

Includes an interactive dashboard built with **Dash + Plotly**.

👉 *Repository coming soon*

## 📈 3. Time Series Forecasting for Resource Optimization  
**Technologies:** Python, Prophet, LSTM, sklearn, Dash**

Pipeline capable of:
- forecasting resource consumption  
- evaluating model drift  
- providing interactive scenario simulation via Dash dashboard  

👉 *Repository coming soon*

## 📊 4. Dashboards & Visualization Collection  
A collection of professional dashboards using:
- Dash / Plotly  
- Altair  
- Streamlit  

Examples include:
- High-dimensional embeddings  
- Cluster exploration  
- Time series anomaly detection
